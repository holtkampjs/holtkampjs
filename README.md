## About me
Hi, I'm a senior studying software engineering at Iowa State University. 

I work at the Iowa DNR on my internship as a full-stack developer. Previously I have worked at a small start-up called CattleTEC and on my first internship with LEAN Technologies. 

In work, these are the tech stacks and tools I worked with: 
  DNR: C#, jQuery, SQL Server, Razor syntax, .NET MVC 5, bootstrap, Git, Visual Studio, Azure DevOps, Agile, and LINQ.
  CattleTEC: Agile, Clubhouse(now Shortcut), Angular, Ionic, TypeScript, MongoDB, AWS, VSCode, Bootstrap, and Git. 
  LEAN Tech: Agile/Scrum/Lean, ASP.NET, Visual Basic, Telerik, Python, Regular Expressions, and Bootstrap. 

In school, I have worked with the following tools and technologies: 
  Java, VBA, C, React, VHDL, Verilog, Embedded Systems, Android Studio, SQL, MDX, MySql, and Linux. 
  
Some of these ^^^ I have a strong understanding of, others I merely encountered. 

## Current interests
I love experimenting with python, Go, and Node. I'm learning how to use Go and Flutter just for fun and possibly applying them to upcomming projects.
